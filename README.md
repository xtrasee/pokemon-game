## Process

I first took some time to look at other coders' submissions through The Odin Project to find inspiration on how I wanted to design the application and what components I wanted to include in my game. 

After looking over a few examples, I skimmed over the PokeAPI documentation and decided to retrieve data using the fetch method.

While incorporating the API, I had to thoroughly think about what states I had too keep track of and when to update it throughout the code.

After I completed most of the game functionality, I quickly decided to add an addition pop-up component to explain in detail what the instructions of the game are.

Finally, I had to do quite a lot of trial and errors to test out and make the design responsive on mobile.

## Learnings

- Retrieving data from API using the fetch method
- Link usage for React JS
- UseState and UseEffect

## Improvements

- Mobile responsive design for card deck
- More visually appealing ending Game component (You Won! and Game Over page)
- Incorporate some type of click effect for each Card
